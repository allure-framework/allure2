# Allure Report [![build-badge][]][build] [![release-badge][]][release] [![bintray-badge][]][bintray] [![Backers on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/allure-report/backers/badge.svg)](#backers) [![Sponsors on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/allure-report/sponsors/badge.svg)](#sponsors) 

Allure Framework is a flexible lightweight multi-language test report tool that not only 
shows a very concise representation of what have been tested in a neat web report form, 
but allows everyone participating in the development process to extract maximum of useful 
information from everyday execution of tests.
